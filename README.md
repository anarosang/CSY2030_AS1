<h2>Brief:</h2>
<p>Design, implement and test a stand-alone University Human Resources system using objectoriented principles in Java and accessed using a graphical user interface. Design should include use cases and a class diagram while testing should include black box and white box testing.</p>
<h2>The specific requirements:</h2>
<p>Assume the new Northampton Metropolitan University would like a system for their human resources department to keep track of lecturing staff who work in various departments through a graphical user interface. The system also allows a department secretary to view the details of all the lecturers in his/her department. Human resources staff access the system through a single user name and password. Likewise, department secretaries access the system through a different user name and password which is stored with each department (see below).</p>
<p>The new Northampton Metropolitan University will be made up departments which, in turn, will be made up of lecturers. The human resources department need to keep track of each department and their associated staff.</p>
<p>Each department has a name (e.g Physics, Chemistry etc), type of department (e.g Science, Arts, Engineering etc) and a web address. For each department we also store a user name and password to allow a department secretary to log in to view the lecturers in his/her department.</p>
<p>Each department is made up of lecturers. The new University has the following 3 distinct types of lecturers:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Full-time Lecturers – each full-time lecturer has a staff identification number, name, address, phone number, email address, the date they started and their salary.</li>
  <li>Part-time Lecturers – each full-time lecturer has a staff identification number, name, address, phone number, email address, the date they started and their hourly rate.</li>
  <li>Contract Lecturers – each full-time lecturer has a staff identification number, name, address, phone number, email address, the date they started, salary and the date their contract will finish.</li>
</ol>
